# Welcome to Kalvi
**Kalvi** - Improves learner engagement and **increases completion** rate by incentivizing learning by streaming rewards.

## Preamble 

**COVID** has changed learning forever. There is a paradigm shift in the way people learnt pre and post COVID, there is high growth and adoption in Education Technology. We are experiencing an unplanned and rapid migration to online learning. A huge number of people started joining online courses to **reskill** and **upskill**.

It is clear that this pandemic has utterly disrupted the way we learn. It had both positive and negative impacts. There was a terrible disconnect between the enrollment rate and completion rate which questioned the impact of online learning.

## Problem Statement

Learner's drop out rate is up by **67 %** with most of them leaving due to a lack of Motivation and engaging content. We need to fix this problem by focusing on ways to **Motivate** the users ,Personalise and **Reward** their learning journey.

## Mission Statement 

To build an Edutech dApp (Kalvi) to reskill and upskill the learning community across the globe. Kalvi makes them more productive and efficient by providing personalized content, learning pathways with AI-driven recommendations (future roadmap) and by using LTEM (Learning-Transfer Evaluation / **Kirk Patricks Model**) to increase **ROI** on learners journey . Kalvi **Incentivizes** learners by streaming **rewards** when a certain **milestone** is achieved.
